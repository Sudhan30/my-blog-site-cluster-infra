# Grafana Troubleshooting Scripts

This directory contains all the scripts used during the Grafana setup and troubleshooting process.

## Working Solution

**`fix-grafana-definitive.sh`** - The final working script that successfully sets up Grafana with proper authentication.

### Final Grafana Credentials
- **URL**: https://grafana.sudharsana.dev
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: Generated dynamically (see script output)

## Script History

The following scripts were used during troubleshooting and are archived for reference:

1. `setup-secure-grafana.sh` - Initial secure setup attempt
2. `verify-grafana-fresh-start.sh` - Verification script
3. `fix-grafana-secret-final.sh` - Secret update attempt
4. `fix-grafana-complete.sh` - Complete fix attempt
5. `fix-grafana-multiple-methods.sh` - Multiple authentication methods
6. `fix-grafana-api-approach.sh` - API-based approach
7. `fix-grafana-initial-setup.sh` - Initial setup diagnostic
8. `fix-grafana-config-override.sh` - Configuration override
9. `fix-grafana-secret-final-fix.sh` - Final secret fix
10. `fix-grafana-secret-once-and-for-all.sh` - Once and for all attempt
11. `test-grafana-login.sh` - Login testing script
12. `access-grafana-via-browser.sh` - Browser access script

## What Was Fixed

The main issue was that Grafana wasn't properly using environment variables for authentication. The solution involved:

1. Completely removing the old deployment
2. Creating a fresh deployment with proper environment variables
3. Using a fixed, secure password
4. Adding comprehensive security settings
5. Properly configuring the ingress

## Usage

If you need to recreate Grafana from scratch, use:
```bash
./fix-grafana-definitive.sh
```

This script will:
- Remove any existing Grafana deployment
- Create a fresh deployment with proper configuration
- Generate and set up secure credentials dynamically
- Configure external access via ingress
- Test the login functionality
- Display the generated password for you to save securely
